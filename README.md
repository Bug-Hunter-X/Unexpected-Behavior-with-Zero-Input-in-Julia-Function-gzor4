# Julia Code Bug: Handling Zero Input

This repository demonstrates a common, subtle bug in Julia code that involves unexpected behavior when a function receives zero as input. The `myfunction` demonstrates the issue, while `bugSolution.jl` provides a corrected version.

The bug is related to the handling of the zero case, which might not align with intended behavior in all situations. The solution addresses this edge case by explicitly handling zero input to ensure a consistent and predictable function output. 

## Bug Description
The function `myfunction` correctly squares positive numbers and returns the absolute value of negative numbers. However, its behavior when the input is zero may lead to unexpected results. The original implementation uses `if x > 0`, inadvertently excluding the case of x being 0, leading to a potential unexpected output or failure in some application contexts.
